## How It Works

The extension fetches wholesale energy prices once per hour from the EnergyZero API and calculates either the wholesale or all-in price based on user settings. Prices are displayed in the Raycast menu bar as follows:

ðŸ’¡â‚¬[Electricity Price] | ðŸ”¥â‚¬[Gas Price]

Clicking on the displayed prices opens a modal showing additional hourly electricity prices and the daily gas price.

## Example Menu

For example, with an extra_uren setting of 6, the modal might display:

10:00  ðŸ’¡â‚¬0.342
11:00  ðŸ’¡â‚¬0.333
12:00  ðŸ’¡â‚¬0.352
13:00  ðŸ’¡â‚¬0.365
14:00  ðŸ’¡â‚¬0.322
15:00  ðŸ’¡â‚¬0.335
Daily  ðŸ”¥â‚¬0.671

## API

The extension uses the EnergyZero API to retrieve current wholesale prices. Please note:

	â€¢	Gas: usageType=3
	â€¢	Electricity: usageType=1
